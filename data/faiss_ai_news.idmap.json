Before that, he founded Behance, a global portfolio site that he sold to Adobe in late 2012. He had a long run at Adobe, serving as its chief product officer and later chief strategy officer. This month he became the newest member of the Cornell Tech Council, and has written books like The Messy Middle and Making Ideas Happen . Belsky sits at the intersection of ideas and infrastructure, with the keen ability to frame the creative process in a way that\u2019s both practical and magic. Still, Belsky doesn\u2019t romanticize any of this. \u201cI\u2019m always thinking about the inputs in my life and trying to make sure I don\u2019t get too stagnant and boring,\u201d says Belsky. \u201cAll of the things you\u2019re exposed to act as outputs.\u201d Belsky has worked for years building his own \u201ccreative system of production\u201d and the nuggets he shares here are a result of the fact that his \u201csystem\u201d is equally rooted in two worlds: \u201cI have always straddled one foot in the creative world and one foot in the business world. When I get too businessy it compromises the ingenuity that I can bring to the product and the things I\u2019m trying to create or write. It is a tension to constantly maintain in order to ensure you\u2019re not just basking in the stuff you\u2019ve done before.\u201d I\u2019m constantly, constantly capturing stuff. It takes a little bit of the romanticism out of it, but I\u2019ve come to believe a lot of creativity is simply capturing things the moment they hit, and then tending to them with such consistency that you start to connect little pieces into a bigger thing. And then when you connect little things to big things and then bigger things into each other, then you end up with something amazing. It can be a book or a screenplay or some sort of business strategy or a new business. If I look at myself over the last couple of decades, it\u2019s all about capturing things and then servicing them with the right moment and in the right way. Another thing that comes to mind is the role of others. Sometimes they have the missing pieces to the thing you\u2019re building. Sometimes I\u2019ll meet somebody who has an idea or has a skill that captures something I had thought of years ago and suddenly I realize they are part of this project or puzzle. I work to graft them onto it in such a way that makes it come to life. That wouldn\u2019t have been possible had it not been for the discipline of going back and tending to the pieces that seemed dormant and irrelevant until suddenly they weren\u2019t. I pick places to go and I sometimes say yes to things I\u2019d ordinarily say no to just get a fresh dose of surprise and exposure to something different. It can come in the form of a speaking engagement somewhere super inconvenient that\u2019s not even paying me, but I\u2019ll do it because I have a sense this will take me out of my comfort zone in some way. I also try to listen to new music and read things that are from new sources. I have a bit of a paranoia that somehow my input could get stale and my output would then become uninteresting to me and others. There is something to extract from everywhere if you have the skeleton key for it\u2014which is usually the right dose of curiosity. The ultimate test is when I go to a dinner I was dragged into. I\u2019ll say to myself this is going to be completely uninteresting. I try to find the skeleton key to the person or topic\u2014it will usually be me mining curiosity, like how does that work or why is that the way it is? I\u2019ll go deep into some backstory and it unlocks a door of intrigue and new material that is input, again. It\u2019s like squeezing water from air. If you have the technology, water is everywhere; you don\u2019t have to look for the well. I\u2019ve also been impacted as a parent. When you have a kid, their inputs are just what you expose them to. It\u2019s a closed room experiment. Only for a short period of time, before they go out in the world and start watching TV\u2014before they start getting inundated with inputs that cannot be traced, you have this previous zone where everything they do you can trace back to the input they were exposed to. It\u2019s this fascinating laboratory of understanding creativity. Suddenly you can see the whole system and you can extrapolate how it impacts you and others because they are in the world. Texture and friction are how we remember time. The hardest, hardest vacations to remember are beach vacations; they all kind of blend together. You just remember sitting on the beach. I love the beach, but there\u2019s no friction in sitting and relaxing all day. Therefore, it\u2019s hard to discern between the beaches you sat on in your vacations. Juxtapose that with getting lost on some street in rural Italy or arduously climbing some mountaintop or something like that. You\u00a0remember those vividly because they were friction-filled. Time with friction is what makes us remember it. I have these two realizations: One is that at the end of your life, you will have felt like you lived longer based on how much time had texture and how much time you remember. In that essence, texture and time is what makes life longer. The other is that maybe it\u2019s the inputs that have texture and friction that impact us the most. I definitely believe that pain is a source of creativity. I hate to say it but it\u2019s true. You look at Billy Joel. His greatest albums came out of a divorce or his addiction. Everyone suffering is rife with texture and friction. It also probably rife with inputs and emotion, struggle, insight, realization. Whenever I struggle, there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s grateful I still have kindling. I learn to appreciate the troughs of life. Let\u2019s do something with this. I\u2019ve become very purposeful with my time. I\u2019m in a startup environment building something new. I run product, design, and development teams. I have a sacred three hours every week that we call concepting. It is a block of time when we review product and have a more product and design driven controlled meeting, as opposed to an engineering one. It\u2019s not a meeting to talk about the cost of doing something. It\u2019s a meeting about, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best product?\u201d That\u2019s a mistake a lot of teams make. They\u2019ll include engineers in that first product design meeting. And if you have engineers, it\u2019s okay. But they can\u2019t be thinking, \u201cHow am I going to implement this and is that going to be too expensive in time or money?\u201d They have to be thinking, \u201cWhat\u2019s possible? How do we solve this problem?\u201d That\u2019s a really sacred time. Every team I\u2019ve ever managed, I have these concepting blocks. My team, we are very empowered. We have a standup every Monday. Every Friday, everyone gives an update on every project they lead. Everyone is entrusted to use their time and energy to make the greatest impact. It\u2019s important to have a team that can be trusted. Full transparency. Everyone does it. Including me. I am one that always looks ahead. I have to make choices. I have a list in Notion of the things that are most important to me and I try to look at it every few days to pressure check myself against my calendar on how I\u2019m using my time. What\u2019s important to me right now? One of them might be a project that has many short-term deliverables. I have one for work, one for the companies I\u2019m investing in and supporting, and I have one for my personal life\u2014my health and fitness, my relationships with my family. I just think that a quick glance over it is a recalibration of your brain that helps you make better decisions every day. Writing is my craft of processing and testing things myself and then testing things with others. I\u2019m tending to these fragments and these ideas. Both books I wrote were the result of lots of different pieces I captured. The Messy Middle was seven years of just capturing stuff and finally seeing the way they come together. I find writing a great form of getting ideas out there. I have forced myself to write this thing called Implications, which is one way I test ideas on the technology side and I learn what people engage with or disengage with. I do the same thing with social media. I don\u2019t consume a lot of social media but everything I do, I share on X. It\u2019s an instant way of engagement and testing ideas. It\u2019s an amazing tool. It helps me triangulate where I should put my focus and energy. I try to run three to five miles every morning. It\u2019s a principled period of time where I\u2019m forced to unplug. I listen to music but I never look at my phone. I just think and it\u2019s also a great part of my chemistry and how my brain works. I swear by it. Do I even listen to the music? For some reason the music makes it easier to run. Do I love running? Or, do I just love everything that happens because of the running? When I\u2019m running I force myself to complete the run and almost always the idea has become much better. It taught me to wait and not capture and move on from the idea so fast, to sit with something. Should we be careful not to capture actions so quickly and stick with a creative process long enough so ideas build? This is the art and science of creativity. By capturing something so quickly we\u2019re making ourselves at ease with the fact that we\u2019ve captured it. When I tend to something over time, is that the equivalent of running and having to think about it more? The best practice would be to have both. Don\u2019t let something go. Capture it when it hits and tend to it over time so the pieces fit together. Let yourself keep going. Force yourself not to capture it so quickly.", "content": "When Scott Belsky talks about creativity, he uses words like \u201coutput\u201d and \u201cproduction.\u201d \u201cCreativity is the source, with the problem of mining,\u201d says the founder, author, and early stage investor. \u201cIt requires machinery and practice and discipline and whatever else.\u201d Belsky joined A24 as the head of A24 Labs in early 2025. Before that, he founded Behance, a global portfolio site that he sold to Adobe in late 2012. He had a long run at Adobe, serving as its chief product officer and later chief strategy officer. This month he became the newest member of the Cornell Tech Council, and has written books like The Messy Middle and Making Ideas Happen . Belsky sits at the intersection of ideas and infrastructure, with the keen ability to frame the creative process in a way that\u2019s both practical and magic. Still, Belsky doesn\u2019t romanticize any of this. \u201cI\u2019m always thinking about the inputs in my life and trying to make sure I don\u2019t get too stagnant and boring,\u201d says Belsky. \u201cAll of the things you\u2019re exposed to act as outputs.\u201d Belsky has worked for years building his own \u201ccreative system of production\u201d and the nuggets he shares here are a result of the fact that his \u201csystem\u201d is equally rooted in two worlds: \u201cI have always straddled one foot in the creative world and one foot in the business world. When I get too businessy it compromises the ingenuity that I can bring to the product and the things I\u2019m trying to create or write. It is a tension to constantly maintain in order to ensure you\u2019re not just basking in the stuff you\u2019ve done before.\u201d I\u2019m constantly, constantly capturing stuff. It takes a little bit of the romanticism out of it, but I\u2019ve come to believe a lot of creativity is simply capturing things the moment they hit, and then tending to them with such consistency that you start to connect little pieces into a bigger thing. And then when you connect little things to big things and then bigger things into each other, then you end up with something amazing. It can be a book or a screenplay or some sort of business strategy or a new business. If I look at myself over the last couple of decades, it\u2019s all about capturing things and then servicing them with the right moment and in the right way. Another thing that comes to mind is the role of others. Sometimes they have the missing pieces to the thing you\u2019re building. Sometimes I\u2019ll meet somebody who has an idea or has a skill that captures something I had thought of years ago and suddenly I realize they are part of this project or puzzle. I work to graft them onto it in such a way that makes it come to life. That wouldn\u2019t have been possible had it not been for the discipline of going back and tending to the pieces that seemed dormant and irrelevant until suddenly they weren\u2019t. I pick places to go and I sometimes say yes to things I\u2019d ordinarily say no to just get a fresh dose of surprise and exposure to something different. It can come in the form of a speaking engagement somewhere super inconvenient that\u2019s not even paying me, but I\u2019ll do it because I have a sense this will take me out of my comfort zone in some way. I also try to listen to new music and read things that are from new sources. I have a bit of a paranoia that somehow my input could get stale and my output would then become uninteresting to me and others. There is something to extract from everywhere if you have the skeleton key for it\u2014which is usually the right dose of curiosity. The ultimate test is when I go to a dinner I was dragged into. I\u2019ll say to myself this is going to be completely uninteresting. I try to find the skeleton key to the person or topic\u2014it will usually be me mining curiosity, like how does that work or why is that the way it is? I\u2019ll go deep into some backstory and it unlocks a door of intrigue and new material that is input, again. It\u2019s like squeezing water from air. If you have the technology, water is everywhere; you don\u2019t have to look for the well. I\u2019ve also been impacted as a parent. When you have a kid, their inputs are just what you expose them to. It\u2019s a closed room experiment. Only for a short period of time, before they go out in the world and start watching TV\u2014before they start getting inundated with inputs that cannot be traced, you have this previous zone where everything they do you can trace back to the input they were exposed to. It\u2019s this fascinating laboratory of understanding creativity. Suddenly you can see the whole system and you can extrapolate how it impacts you and others because they are in the world. Texture and friction are how we remember time. The hardest, hardest vacations to remember are beach vacations; they all kind of blend together. You just remember sitting on the beach. I love the beach, but there\u2019s no friction in sitting and relaxing all day. Therefore, it\u2019s hard to discern between the beaches you sat on in your vacations. Juxtapose that with getting lost on some street in rural Italy or arduously climbing some mountaintop or something like that. You\u00a0remember those vividly because they were friction-filled. Time with friction is what makes us remember it. I have these two realizations: One is that at the end of your life, you will have felt like you lived longer based on how much time had texture and how much time you remember. In that essence, texture and time is what makes life longer. The other is that maybe it\u2019s the inputs that have texture and friction that impact us the most. I definitely believe that pain is a source of creativity. I hate to say it but it\u2019s true. You look at Billy Joel. His greatest albums came out of a divorce or his addiction. Everyone suffering is rife with texture and friction. It also probably rife with inputs and emotion, struggle, insight, realization. Whenever I struggle, there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s grateful I still have kindling. I learn to appreciate the troughs of life. Let\u2019s do something with this. I\u2019ve become very purposeful with my time. I\u2019m in a startup environment building something new. I run product, design, and development teams. I have a sacred three hours every week that we call concepting. It is a block of time when we review product and have a more product and design driven controlled meeting, as opposed to an engineering one. It\u2019s not a meeting to talk about the cost of doing something. It\u2019s a meeting about, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best product?\u201d That\u2019s a mistake a lot of teams make. They\u2019ll include engineers in that first product design meeting. And if you have engineers, it\u2019s okay. But they can\u2019t be thinking, \u201cHow am I going to implement this and is that going to be too expensive in time or money?\u201d They have to be thinking, \u201cWhat\u2019s possible? How do we solve this problem?\u201d That\u2019s a really sacred time. Every team I\u2019ve ever managed, I have these concepting blocks. My team, we are very empowered. We have a standup every Monday. Every Friday, everyone gives an update on every project they lead. Everyone is entrusted to use their time and energy to make the greatest impact. It\u2019s important to have a team that can be trusted. Full transparency. Everyone does it. Including me. I am one that always looks ahead. I have to make choices. I have a list in Notion of the things that are most important to me and I try to look at it every few days to pressure check myself against my calendar on how I\u2019m using my time. What\u2019s important to me right now? One of them might be a project that has many short-term deliverables. I have one for work, one for the companies I\u2019m investing in and supporting, and I have one for my personal life\u2014my health and fitness, my relationships with my family. I just think that a quick glance over it is a recalibration of your brain that helps you make better decisions every day. Writing is my craft of processing and testing things myself and then testing things with others. I\u2019m tending to these fragments and these ideas. Both books I wrote were the result of lots of different pieces I captured. The Messy Middle was seven years of just capturing stuff and finally seeing the way they come together. I find writing a great form of getting ideas out there. I have forced myself to write this thing called Implications, which is one way I test ideas on the technology side and I learn what people engage with or disengage with. I do the same thing with social media. I don\u2019t consume a lot of social media but everything I do, I share on X. It\u2019s an instant way of engagement and testing ideas. It\u2019s an amazing tool. It helps me triangulate where I should put my focus and energy. I try to run three to five miles every morning. It\u2019s a principled period of time where I\u2019m forced to unplug. I listen to music but I never look at my phone. I just think and it\u2019s also a great part of my chemistry and how my brain works. I swear by it. Do I even listen to the music? For some reason the music makes it easier to run. Do I love running? Or, do I just love everything that happens because of the running? When I\u2019m running I force myself to complete the run and almost always the idea has become much better. It taught me to wait and not capture and move on from the idea so fast, to sit with something. Should we be careful not to capture actions so quickly and stick with a creative process long enough so ideas build? This is the art and science of creativity. By capturing something so quickly we\u2019re making ourselves at ease with the fact that we\u2019ve captured it. When I tend to something over time, is that the equivalent of running and having to think about it more? The best practice would be to have both. Don\u2019t let something go. Capture it when it hits and tend to it over time so the pieces fit together. Let yourself keep going. Force yourself not to capture it so quickly.", "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91415164/a24s-scott-belsky-fuels-his-creativity-with-a-fresh-dose-of-surprise", "publishedAt": "2025-10-04T11:00:00+00:00", "source": {"name": "Fast Company"}, "urlToImage": ""}}, "2": {"ts": 1759722664, "article": {"title": "Beyond Von Neumann: Toward a unified deterministic architecture", "description": "A cycle-accurate alternative to speculation \u2014 unifying scalar, vector and matrix compute For more than half a century, computing has relied on the Von Neumann or Harvard model.

Prudential warned us in 2023 that more than a third of Gen Xers had less than $10k in retirement savings . In 2024, Natixis Investments found that 48% of Gen Xers said it would take a miracle for them to retire securely (up from only 41% of Generation X counting on divine intervention as of 2021). Even the much-lauded great wealth transfer \u2014the $124 trillion in assets that baby boomers will pass along to their heirs by the year 2048\u2014will largely skip over Gen X. The wealth management firm Cerulli Associates anticipates that millennials will be the biggest beneficiaries of the wealth transfer, inheriting $46 trillion over the next 25 years. While none of this is good news, Gen X has been preparing for this challenge our entire lives. As the generational \u201cmiddle child,\u201d we Gen Xers have spent our lives quietly taking care of ourselves, figuring out new technology as it appeared, and basically getting on with it while everyone else bickered amongst themselves. Here\u2019s how the Gen X core competencies, which we\u2019ve honed over decades, will allow us to seize a secure retirement from the jaws of financial instability. Gen X is known for self-reliance Since elementary school, we have known we have to take care of things on our own. In our youth, American society wrung their collective hands over parents\u2019 \u201cabandonment\u201d of latchkey kids. Not only did TV stations air guilt-tripping PSAs about what kinds of drug use we were up to while Mom was working late, but columnists also bemoaned the fate of lonely, frightened children coming home to empty houses. Meanwhile, educational, medical, and psychological journals found that the lack of supervision didn\u2019t seem to harm latchkey kids. Instead of falling into drug use \u00e0 la Go Ask Alice , most of us learned to independently handle homework, chores, and little siblings. Being left unsupervised after school was just the start of the Gen X trend of self-reliance. We also came of age at the same time pensions disappeared , meaning we were left to our own devices to navigate a new world of retirement planning. The IRS had just introduced defined contribution retirement plans (i.e., 401(k) plans) as the eldest Gen Xers joined the workforce, meaning there was no map or precedent available to guide us. It\u2019s little wonder that Gen X didn\u2019t necessarily start contributing to retirement right away. Creating a latchkey retirement We may have learned self-reliance because we had to\u2014both when we were responsible for starting dinner after school and funding our own retirement after pensions went poof\u2014but that skill will continue to serve us as we face an uncertain retirement. Since we know we can only count on ourselves, we can tap into that quiet, competent independence we are known for to make retirement work. That starts by looking at what you can do to lower your costs and increase your income to help you set aside more money for retirement. For many Gen Xers, the answer is entrepreneurship. A recent survey by ZenBusiness found that 40% of Gen X respondents plan to start or have already launched a business as part of their retirement plan. Even if the idea of being a small business owner gives you hives, making a personal financial plan that puts the power in your hands can help you feel in control. Gen X is known for tech savviness Millennials and Gen Z may be digital natives, but Gen Xers were the kids who were around when the technology was new. This gives us a better-than-native perspective since we not only remember the breathless optimism of every new technological advancement (remember when we thought computers were magic? ) but we also have had the dubious privilege of troubleshooting misbehaving tech until we have a clearer understanding of its real uses and limitations. This means we embrace new technologies as they appear, but keep hold of our skepticism about their potential usefulness until we\u2019ve seen it for ourselves. (We\u2019re also the ones who have to tell our kids and our parents not to get taken in by AI slop.) Troubleshoot your retirement Because we were lucky enough to live through the tech boom of our youth, we are comfortable with technology and we have the patience to learn how to use it, rather than simply assume it will work without our input. (Digital natives have never had to blow on a Nintendo game cartridge and it shows.) AI is the \u201ctechnology is magic\u201d du jour, and our generation is skeptical about the promises that it will increase productivity , replace professional workers , and even make julienne fries. But we learned to use personal computers, even though they can\u2019t actually create Kelly LeBrock out of magazine images. So we can make large language models and large reasoning models work for us, even though they can\u2019t replace human thinking. Specifically, Gen X may want to consider using AI to help with budgeting. In addition to apps that use AI to help you budget , you can also ask chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude.ai for help. If you\u2019re comfortable doing so, this could mean giving the chatbot your monthly income and expenses and asking for help creating a budget or savings strategies. Alternatively, you could ask open-ended questions like: I need to contribute more money to my 401(k). How can I find some money in my monthly budget to send to my retirement accounts? I currently spend $600 per month on groceries. What are some ways to reduce that amount by 20%? My energy bills last winter averaged $250 per month. How can I reduce my costs to $175 per month? As with any AI response, you will need to make sure you double check the answers to make sure they\u2019re not an AI hallucination. But using these models to help you see different financial options is a good way to embrace the real opportunities offered by AI. It\u2019s not slacking when you get the job done Generation X were labeled as slackers for a number of reasons. Our priorities were different from those of our parents, which the establishment saw as laziness. Pensions went extinct when we started working, so our dearth of retirement savings seemed like a lack of foresight on our part. We learned early on not to count on anyone but ourselves, which can look like not being a team player. But Gen Xers have never been slackers at any point in our lives, least of all as we look toward retirement. We\u2019re former latchkey kids who know how to create an independent plan to take care of ourselves. That may mean entrepreneurship or simply taking the reins of retirement planning. We\u2019re tech savvy digital troubleshooters who understand the limitations of new technologies and use them creatively throughout our lives. Currently, that means harnessing the power of AI to help identify ways to set aside more money for retirement. We are the quiet, cynical, creative, competent generation. It would be a mistake to underestimate us.", "content": "These days, you can\u2019t swing a vintage pair of Doc Martens without hitting a new study or article describing why Gen X won\u2019t live up to its retirement potential.

Creating a latchkey retirement We may have learned self-reliance because we had to\u2014both when we were responsible for starting dinner after school and funding our own retirement after pensions went poof\u2014but that skill will continue to serve us as we face an uncertain retirement. Since we know we can only count on ourselves, we can tap into that quiet, competent independence we are known for to make retirement work. That starts by looking at what you can do to lower your costs and increase your income to help you set aside more money for retirement. For many Gen Xers, the answer is entrepreneurship. A recent survey by ZenBusiness found that 40% of Gen X respondents plan to start or have already launched a business as part of their retirement plan. Even if the idea of being a small business owner gives you hives, making a personal financial plan that puts the power in your hands can help you feel in control. Gen X is known for tech savviness Millennials and Gen Z may be digital natives, but Gen Xers were the kids who were around when the technology was new. This gives us a better-than-native perspective since we not only remember the breathless optimism of every new technological advancement (remember when we thought computers were magic? ) but we also have had the dubious privilege of troubleshooting misbehaving tech until we have a clearer understanding of its real uses and limitations. This means we embrace new technologies as they appear, but keep hold of our skepticism about their potential usefulness until we\u2019ve seen it for ourselves. (We\u2019re also the ones who have to tell our kids and our parents not to get taken in by AI slop.) Troubleshoot your retirement Because we were lucky enough to live through the tech boom of our youth, we are comfortable with technology and we have the patience to learn how to use it, rather than simply assume it will work without our input. (Digital natives have never had to blow on a Nintendo game cartridge and it shows.) AI is the \u201ctechnology is magic\u201d du jour, and our generation is skeptical about the promises that it will increase productivity , replace professional workers , and even make julienne fries. But we learned to use personal computers, even though they can\u2019t actually create Kelly LeBrock out of magazine images. So we can make large language models and large reasoning models work for us, even though they can\u2019t replace human thinking. Specifically, Gen X may want to consider using AI to help with budgeting. In addition to apps that use AI to help you budget , you can also ask chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude.ai for help. If you\u2019re comfortable doing so, this could mean giving the chatbot your monthly income and expenses and asking for help creating a budget or savings strategies. Alternatively, you could ask open-ended questions like: I need to contribute more money to my 401(k). How can I find some money in my monthly budget to send to my retirement accounts? I currently spend $600 per month on groceries. What are some ways to reduce that amount by 20%? My energy bills last winter averaged $250 per month. How can I reduce my costs to $175 per month? As with any AI response, you will need to make sure you double check the answers to make sure they\u2019re not an AI hallucination. But using these models to help you see different financial options is a good way to embrace the real opportunities offered by AI. It\u2019s not slacking when you get the job done Generation X were labeled as slackers for a number of reasons. Our priorities were different from those of our parents, which the establishment saw as laziness. Pensions went extinct when we started working, so our dearth of retirement savings seemed like a lack of foresight on our part. We learned early on not to count on anyone but ourselves, which can look like not being a team player. But Gen Xers have never been slackers at any point in our lives, least of all as we look toward retirement. We\u2019re former latchkey kids who know how to create an independent plan to take care of ourselves. That may mean entrepreneurship or simply taking the reins of retirement planning. We\u2019re tech savvy digital troubleshooters who understand the limitations of new technologies and use them creatively throughout our lives. Currently, that means harnessing the power of AI to help identify ways to set aside more money for retirement. We are the quiet, cynical, creative, competent generation. It would be a mistake to underestimate us.", "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91414316/why-gen-x-is-uniquely-suited-to-handle-bad-retirement-prospects", "publishedAt": "2025-10-04T10:00:00+00:00", "source": {"name": "Fast Company"}, "urlToImage": ""}}, "4": {"ts": 1759722664, "article": {"title": "States are rethinking student cellphone use, but digital devices are still essential in classrooms", "description": "Across the U.S., more schools are implementing policies restricting cellphones as concerns about digital distraction , mental health , and academic performance rise. The scale of the issue is significant. According to a 2023 report from Common Sense Media , 97% of students between the ages of 11 and 17 use their cellphones at least once during the school day. These students spend a median of 43 minutes online each day during school hours. Social media, YouTube, and gaming were the students\u2019 top cellphone uses. Schools have already begun taking action. Data from the National Center for Education Statistics published in 2025 shows that 77% of public schools ban cellphones during classes. Some 38% of schools have cellphone policies that restrict use outside of class as well\u2014including during free periods, between classes, or during extracurricular activities. Policymakers in different states and educators in school districts across the country are putting into place a variety of solutions. Some rely on partial restrictions, while others enforce complete bans. Many are still searching for the balance between technology access and minimizing distraction. What is clear, however, is that cellphones have become one of the central issues shaping today\u2019s classroom environment. The role of technology in the classroom As researchers and professors who study the integration of technology for teaching and learning \u2014and who are also parents of school-age children\u2014we firmly believe that digital technologies are no longer optional add-ons.

Yet, when not integrated thoughtfully and regulated effectively, they can inadvertently reduce focus and undermine learning. Our recent systematic review on digital distraction in classrooms , which synthesized 26 empirical studies, finds three main drivers of distraction among students: Technology-related factors included constant social networking, texting, and cellphone addiction. These accounted for over half of the reported distractions. Personal needs , such as entertainment, made up more than one-third. Instructional environment , including classroom instruction that isn\u2019t engaging, poor classroom management, and difficult course content, accounted for the rest. To address these challenges, the authors of the papers we reviewed suggested strategies such as teaching students how to control their own behavior and focus, silencing notifications, issuing clear device policies, or banning devices. The studies in our review also drew a clear distinction between school-provided and personally owned mobile devices. Devices provided by schools are typically equipped for instructional purposes, enhanced with stronger security and designed to restrict distracting uses. Personal devices are far less regulated and more prone to off-task use. As schools increasingly provide devices designed for learning, the role of personal cellphones in classrooms becomes harder to justify as they present more risks of distraction than educational benefits. Laws and policies regarding cellphone use Several states in the U.S. have passed laws banning or restricting cellphone use in schools, with some notable differences. States vary in how they define wireless communication devices. In Michigan, Senate Bill 234 , passed in May 2025, describes a wireless communication device as an \u201celectronic device capable of, but not limited to, text messaging, voice communication, entertainment, navigation, accessing the internet, or producing email.\u201d While most of the states have several technology types listed under wireless communication devices, a Colorado bill passed in May 2025 clearly identified that laptops and tablets did not fall under the list of restricted wireless communication devices . Most state laws don\u2019t specify whether the bans apply to both personally owned devices and school-owned devices. One exception is the bill Missouri passed in July 2025, which clearly specifies its ban refers only to personal devices. North Carolina made exceptions in a bill approved in July 2025, allowing students to use wireless communication devices for instructional purposes. Other exceptions in the North Carolina bill include an emergency, when students\u2019 individual education programs call for it, and a documented medical condition. In their bills, most states provide recommendations for school districts to create cellphone use policy for their students. To take one typical example, the policy for Wake County in North Carolina, one of the state\u2019s largest school districts , specifically refers to personal wireless communication devices. For elementary and middle school students, they must be silenced and put away between morning and afternoon bells, either in a backpack or locker. For high school students, teachers may allow them to be used for lessons, but they must otherwise be silenced and put away during instructional time. They can be used on school buses with low volume and headphones. Kui Xie is the dean of the College of Education and Human Development at the University of Missouri-Columbia .

While summer conjures images of vacations and play for many children, it can be a time of increased hunger and skipped meals for families working hard to make ends meet. When schools close, so do their cafeterias, meal programs, and pantries, resulting in more than 20 million kids losing their most reliable source of daily nutrition. And with rising food costs and a worsening job market, parents are finding it harder than ever to put nutritious meals on the table. Of the parents surveyed, more than 1 in 3 said they worried about running out of food this past summer, while 70% said inflation and rising food prices made it harder to afford groceries. And nearly 2 in 3 parents expect food costs to continue rising this year, adding to the stress of already strained budgets. The result is a season that, for too many families, is less about carefree childhood and more about hard choices between food, rent, and gas. Investing in Nutrition Is Investing in the Future The costs of hunger extends far beyond the dinner table, demonstrating that hunger isn\u2019t only a moral crisis; it\u2019s an educational and economic crisis as well. Studies confirm that children experiencing food insecurity are sick more often, hospitalized more frequently, and may face developmental deficiencies that alter the architecture of their brains. They may also struggle to concentrate in classrooms, with 83% of parents surveyed by No Kid Hungry saying their children can\u2019t focus when hungry, and 88% reporting that school meals directly improve learning. The costs of a child missing a meal doesn\u2019t end with childhood. It is linked to lower academic performance, behavioral challenges, and reduced lifetime earnings. Children who grow up food insecure often enter the workforce with fewer opportunities and greater barriers to success. But the impact doesn\u2019t stop there. Childhood hunger reverberates across society\u2014contributing to higher healthcare costs, increased demand for special education services, and diminished economic productivity . In fact, research shows that child hunger costs the U.S. economy $160 billion annually in lost potential and increased public spending. Closing the hunger gap together Hunger isn\u2019t a supply problem\u2014it\u2019s a systems problem. With more than enough food in the U.S., hunger is a solvable issue when we all work together, especially through innovative community and business partnerships. People facing hunger have told us that they don\u2019t want charity; they want lasting solutions. Increasingly, companies across industries are stepping up, not only through food donations, cash grants, and volunteers, but by using their size and influence to advocate for stronger policies that protect families. In addition, some are launching large-scale programs\u2014such as PepsiCo\u2019s Food for Good\u2014that leverage corporate capabilities to source, pack, and deliver millions of cost-effective, nutritious meals each year, demonstrating how business can directly help close the hunger gap. Federal nutrition programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) , Summer EBT , and school meals are among the most effective solutions we have. Every dollar invested generates up to $2 in economic return\u2013including healthier kids, better school performance, and stronger earning potential over a lifetime. These programs have already reduced child hunger by 33% and eased stress for working parents, with two-thirds noting school meals lower their family\u2019s anxiety. Rolling them back would not just hurt families today, but undercut America\u2019s workforce and economic competitiveness tomorrow. That\u2019s why corporate leadership is essential.

The choice is clear: Cutbacks carry devastating costs while investment in child nutrition pays dividends for generations. Without collective action, reductions in nutrition spending will carry devastating costs for years to come. Feeding potential and fueling growth The return on investing in childhood food access is both immediate and generational. Every meal served to a child today protects their health, boosts their learning, and fuels their potential to contribute to tomorrow\u2019s economy. Eleven-year-old Elijah, who receives free breakfast and lunch at school, put it simply: \u201cWhen I\u2019m hungry, I get tired or I\u2019ll get distracted. But when I\u2019m not, I\u2019m on-task and I can focus.\u201d With consistent meals, Elijah isn\u2019t just able to concentrate, he\u2019s thriving in his passion for robotics. \u201cIf I\u2019m full, I\u2019m ready for whatever happens,\u201d he said. Elijah\u2019s story is one of millions. Summer programs that provide meals to children who rely on free or reduced-price meals during the school year are especially critical and have been shown to decrease food insecurity and mitigate summer learning loss. Partnerships are already proving what\u2019s possible. Since 2009, PepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation have invested over $75 million in Food for Good, expanding access to nutritious meals for children after school, on weekends, and during the summer. Through this investment, Food for Good partners with food banks\u2014including the Feeding America network, which provided 30 million meals to children last summer. Together, these efforts demonstrate the power of public-private collaboration to reach children at scale, ease family budgets, and build healthier, more resilient communities. Nourishment now is prosperity later Ensuring kids have year-round access to food is one of the smartest investments we can make in human capital.

You try to schedule something for next week, but your calendar is already packed with recurring meetings. So many employees have asked for a particular day off\u2014or requested a particular shift schedule\u2014that you can\u2019t grant all their requests. You post a job listing for a single position and get 250 applications . These situations arise constantly in our work lives, and their analogues come up in our personal lives. But despite their frequency, we often struggle with how to handle them. We barrel through our inbox and move things around on our calendar. We follow (perhaps unwritten) rules to determine which employees get requests filled and which do not. Sometimes we decide it\u2019s too much to figure out ourselves and outsource the whole endeavor to AI . The common theme of the examples above is what economists call excess demand , which arises when more people want something than we can serve. Economists have a go-to solution for excess demand: rising prices. When prices go up, fewer people find that it is worthwhile, or even feasible, to pay for the thing, so they stop asking for it. But there are times when price doesn\u2019t exist\u2014for example, it would be inappropriate to charge people for a job interview. In these scenarios, we don\u2019t use prices, but we still decide who gets what. We respond to emails and take meetings. We decide who gets the day off and who gets the best shift schedule. We interview candidates and eventually hire someone. Instead of prices changing, a \u201chidden market\u201d arises to resolve the excess demand. These hidden markets are under our control. We set the rules to decide who gets what, and we can optimize them. To do so, we must think carefully about what we want our hidden markets to achieve: a set of goals that I call the three E\u2019s: efficiency, equity, and ease. Effective hidden markets are efficient , meaning that they do not waste resources and they give resources to the people who value them most. You want to use your precious inbox time to respond to the emails that will generate the most value for recipients. You want to give the day off to an employee who really values it (say prioritizing a once-in-a-lifetime event, like a child\u2019s graduation, over something that could happen another day, like a beach trip with friends). You want the job to go to the candidate who is the best fit for the firm. Effective hidden markets are equitable , meaning that they treat people fairly. It would be unfair if one employee always got their preferred schedule while an equally deserving employee was always given something less desirable. Effective hidden markets are also easy to participate in. A hidden market would not be easy if getting what you want required an ordeal, like sending a dozen follow-up emails to get a reply or doing personal favors for a manager to get a preferred day off. This three-E framework can help you improve\u2014and even optimize\u2014the hidden markets you control. When I open my inbox, I think a lot about whether I am using my time efficiently. Doing so requires triaging anything that isn\u2019t important. Among my important emails, I first look to see if anything requires my immediate attention. When in doubt, I use a last-in, first-out rule for triage, meaning I prioritize emails that came in later to ones that came in earlier. I do this because people who emailed me most recently might still be working on whatever project they had just pinged me about. If so, a snappy reply might be more valuable to them than to someone who emailed me last night. When I look at my calendar, I ask whether I am being equitable in how I allocate my time. This has caused me to question my recurring meetings, which repeat on the same day and time (e.g., each Thursday at 10 a.m.). Recurring meetings impose a first-in-time, first-in-right rule that gives perpetual access to a scarce resource based on the order in which it was originally claimed. A recurring meeting set up a year ago gets priority (for Thursday at 10 a.m.) over anything that comes later. But a new project might be just as worthy\u2014or even more worthy\u2014of my time than the projects whose meetings are clogging my calendar. It is unfair (and possibly also inefficient) to give it the dregs. Rules for staff scheduling might be based on seniority or worker tenure. In workplaces with regular turnover\u2014where a person who sticks around long enough will eventually go from getting to pick last to getting to pick first\u2014such rules might be fair. But if the same set of workers get their first choices for decades while workers who started a few years later are consistently out of luck, this is no longer equitable. To combat this, many workplaces use first-come, first-served rules to let workers claim vacation days or preferred shifts. While first-come, first-served is familiar and ubiquitous, it is not necessarily easy for market participants. Employees might have to make requests before they know what schedule would be ideal and, if there is a race to sign up, employees must be vigilant about asking immediately once requests start being accepted. But a thoughtful market designer can make these systems easier and more equitable by building in memory, so workers who did not get their first choice this year get priority next year and perhaps by building in a fair lottery (rather than choosing based on whose email request arrived a few seconds earlier). In these situations\u2014and in many others\u2014we are market designers who must resolve excess demand by allocating scarce resources to the many people who want them. Considering the three-Es can help us generate allocations that are efficient, equitable, and easy for market participants. If we do it right, we can achieve a fourth E: elevating us as market designers, so we are as happy as possible with the outcomes.", "content": "Your inbox is brimming with new emails, and you need to decide which to reply to quickly and which to ignore. You try to schedule something for next week, but your calendar is already packed with recurring meetings. So many employees have asked for a particular day off\u2014or requested a particular shift schedule\u2014that you can\u2019t grant all their requests. You post a job listing for a single position and get 250 applications . These situations arise constantly in our work lives, and their analogues come up in our personal lives. But despite their frequency, we often struggle with how to handle them. We barrel through our inbox and move things around on our calendar. We follow (perhaps unwritten) rules to determine which employees get requests filled and which do not. Sometimes we decide it\u2019s too much to figure out ourselves and outsource the whole endeavor to AI . The common theme of the examples above is what economists call excess demand , which arises when more people want something than we can serve. Economists have a go-to solution for excess demand: rising prices. When prices go up, fewer people find that it is worthwhile, or even feasible, to pay for the thing, so they stop asking for it. But there are times when price doesn\u2019t exist\u2014for example, it would be inappropriate to charge people for a job interview. In these scenarios, we don\u2019t use prices, but we still decide who gets what. We respond to emails and take meetings. We decide who gets the day off and who gets the best shift schedule. We interview candidates and eventually hire someone. Instead of prices changing, a \u201chidden market\u201d arises to resolve the excess demand. These hidden markets are under our control. We set the rules to decide who gets what, and we can optimize them. To do so, we must think carefully about what we want our hidden markets to achieve: a set of goals that I call the three E\u2019s: efficiency, equity, and ease. Effective hidden markets are efficient , meaning that they do not waste resources and they give resources to the people who value them most. You want to use your precious inbox time to respond to the emails that will generate the most value for recipients. You want to give the day off to an employee who really values it (say prioritizing a once-in-a-lifetime event, like a child\u2019s graduation, over something that could happen another day, like a beach trip with friends). You want the job to go to the candidate who is the best fit for the firm. Effective hidden markets are equitable , meaning that they treat people fairly. It would be unfair if one employee always got their preferred schedule while an equally deserving employee was always given something less desirable. Effective hidden markets are also easy to participate in. A hidden market would not be easy if getting what you want required an ordeal, like sending a dozen follow-up emails to get a reply or doing personal favors for a manager to get a preferred day off. This three-E framework can help you improve\u2014and even optimize\u2014the hidden markets you control. When I open my inbox, I think a lot about whether I am using my time efficiently. Doing so requires triaging anything that isn\u2019t important. Among my important emails, I first look to see if anything requires my immediate attention. When in doubt, I use a last-in, first-out rule for triage, meaning I prioritize emails that came in later to ones that came in earlier. I do this because people who emailed me most recently might still be working on whatever project they had just pinged me about. If so, a snappy reply might be more valuable to them than to someone who emailed me last night. When I look at my calendar, I ask whether I am being equitable in how I allocate my time. This has caused me to question my recurring meetings, which repeat on the same day and time (e.g., each Thursday at 10 a.m.). Recurring meetings impose a first-in-time, first-in-right rule that gives perpetual access to a scarce resource based on the order in which it was originally claimed. A recurring meeting set up a year ago gets priority (for Thursday at 10 a.m.) over anything that comes later. But a new project might be just as worthy\u2014or even more worthy\u2014of my time than the projects whose meetings are clogging my calendar. It is unfair (and possibly also inefficient) to give it the dregs. Rules for staff scheduling might be based on seniority or worker tenure. In workplaces with regular turnover\u2014where a person who sticks around long enough will eventually go from getting to pick last to getting to pick first\u2014such rules might be fair.

It is designed perfectly for corporations, family offices, and sovereign wealth funds that want to engage in startup investment without managing a full-fledged VC team. Let\u2019s understand the mechanics behind VCaaS and why corporations are embracing it. What is VCaaS? As an innovative, effective model, VCaaS is designed with an established VC firm which works for a corporation or institutional client to invest on its behalf. By using this model, the corporation or client benefits from startup innovation, access to deals, and active portfolio engagement, while avoiding the cost and trouble of setting up its own VC organization. There are a number of unique ways VCaaS works to benefit corporations and startups. Corporations typically want to become more innovative and this model makes this happen. Unique Fund Structure : VCaaS uses a co-investment or Limited Partner focus. By doing so, the corporation involved can set its own priorities, including sectors of investment, technology focus, and area of the world to invest in. This provides a great deal of flexibility to the investing corporation. Dedicated Team (without the hiring headache): A team of experienced investors from the experienced VCaaS firm acts on behalf of the corporate client. By working with such seasoned investors, the corporation benefits from a well-established organization with experts who are looking out for their priorities. Diligence and Deal Sourcing : Since the VC firm involved has strong experience, they can sort out startups based on the corporation\u2019s goals, deliver strong deal flow, and run due diligence\u2014making sure all of this goes smoothly. Because VC investors work with startups continuously, they can quickly and effectively find the best fit. Process of Decision-Making Process : This unique model lets corporations make as many\u2014or as few\u2014decisions as they want to. Some are involved throughout the startup selection process, while others simply want to sign off on final investment decisions. Corporations participate in the process as they want to, without compromise. Management of the Portfolio : Once investments are made, the VC firm makes life easy for the corporation by managing the startup portfolio on a continual basis. They will check on how the startups are doing financially, keep in touch with them, and give the corporation regular updates. This allows for high transparency and flexibility based on how the corporation wants to work. Why VCaaS is Gaining Ground Corporate and institutional investors are increasingly turning to VCaaS because they see its financial and business upside. Investing in startups is an increasingly important practice that is critical for corporations to become more innovative. Corporations count on VCaaS as an effective, reliable, flexible, and affordable model. They appreciate the following benefits: Fast speed to market since there is no need to build an internal VC organization nor hire internal investors Substantial global deal access via the experience VC firm that invests on behalf of the corporation Strong strategic alignment between corporate investment and business priorities High level of operational efficiency with minimal internal cost or burden Brand benefit from being seen as an innovation player\u2014without the risk of a mismanaged internal venture effort VCaaS Case Studies Several case studies come to mind that demonstrate the effectiveness of the VCaaS model. These show how corporations can become more innovative by relying on a trusted VC partner. Sunny Health : A diversified Japanese corporation, Sunny Health partnered with Pegasus Tech Ventures to build a \u00a5350 billion ($2.4 trillion) innovation fund focused on AI , health technology, renewable energy, and deep tech. By partnering, the company avoided building its own internal VC organization from scratch. Aisin : As a global supplier of car components and systems, Aisin is known for its innovation as an automotive leader. The company relied on VCaaS to invest in electronics and mobility startups while staying aligned with its own R&D. By investing, Aisin accelerates the development of future mobility technologies, allowing the company to grow more quickly and surpass competition. Alchemist Accelerator and Siemens : Working together, Siemens enhanced its startup investment program by working with Alchemist Accelerator using the VCaaS model. Together they focus on startups in the industrial Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence sectors.

We\u2019ve covered everything from air fryers to sous vide machines and now, many of those gadgets are on sale. Here are the best Prime Day deals on kitchen tech we recommend, along with links to our testing so you can see why we vouch for it. The best Prime Day kitchen deals Ninja Creami ice cream maker with extra pints $200 ($55 off with Prime) : Here's a bundle that includes two additional pint jars for the ice cream maker. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the unit itself dipped down to $160 last Black Friday and the extra pints have gone as low as $16. Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off) : Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though it\u2019s not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone. Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime) : This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick , but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time. Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off) : Here\u2019s a smaller version of our best overall air fryer. This one has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly thanks to a 1600-watt output. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime) : The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn\u2019t take up a ton of space on your countertops \u2014 ideal for a small kitchen. Breville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off) : We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, it\u2019s pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design \u2014 that actually looks good on a countertop \u2014 somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when you\u2019re bubbling up your drinks. Cosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime) : One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket. Instant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime) : This model\u2019s four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model. It has the Clear Cook window feature, six presets and it comes in pink in addition to the standard white and black. Instant Pot Duo Plus for $90 ($50 off) : We named this the best multicooker in our guide to the best kitchen tech we\u2019ve tested. It can cook a dizzying array of foods from basic beans and rice to homemade yogurt. We like this one because it\u2019s simple to use, and has quick-cooking modes for soup, eggs and grains. There\u2019s even a sous vide cooking function. Breville Bambino Plus for $400 ($100 off) : In our gift guide for coffee lovers , this espresso machine earned our respect for its compact size and the fact that it doesn\u2019t cost a grand, like some machines do. Plus the controls are easy for beginners to learn but makes silky milkfoam for pro-level latte artists. Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $130 ($20 off) : This went as low as $110 back in January, but it\u2019s still a decent discount on a high-powered juice extractor. We were won over by its impressive juicing abilities and despite how it looks, it's surprisingly easy to clean \u2014 as long as you do it right away. Ninja Dual Foodie Zone Air Fryer (DZ302) for $180 ($50 off) : If you want to air fry two different things at the same time, this is the one to get. This is the same in specs, capacity and wattage as our top pick for a dual-zone air fryer , just with a different model number. It even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time. Note the price was $20 lower for Prime members back in July. Ninja 5.5-quart Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) for $130 ($50 off) : This one earned an honorable mention in our guide to air fryers. It\u2019s double the capacity of our budget pick and has a dehydrate preset. While we found the round basket a little cramped, we liked how the fryer\u2019s vertical design saved counter space.

A handful of well-reviewed sets from Samsung, Sony and other name brands are a bit cheaper than usual, including high-end OLEDs and more budget-friendly models alike. We\u2019ve picked through the best October Prime Day TV deals we can find below, and we\u2019ll update this roundup as prices change and more offers arise. Note that the Prime Big Deal Days sale, as the two-day event is technically called, officially runs October 7-8, with some deals exclusive to Prime subscribers. Best Prime Day TV deals Hisense U8QG 65-inch Mini-LED TV for $1,082 ($416 off) : Several reviews suggest that the Hisense U8QG ticks most of the requisite boxes for a LCD TV in 2025: robust local dimming and mini-LED backlighting, exceptionally high brightness, vibrant quantum-dot colors, a fast refresh rate (165Hz in this case), support for the major HDR formats and so on. It\u2019s a higher-end option than something like the TCL QM6K with much better brightness and contrast, though it still falls short of a good OLED TV when it comes to the latter. Like most LCD panels, it\u2019ll also look a bit washed out if you view it from an angle. It has three HDMI 2.1 ports, which is one fewer than many other TVs in this price range, though it uniquely includes a USB-C video input if you want to hook up a gaming laptop or Nintendo Switch. (Just note that you won\u2019t get VRR or HDR when using that.) You\u2019d mainly get it over an OLED TV if you\u2019re willing to trade some picture quality for something that\u2019s better-suited in a bright room. This deal on the 65-inch model isn\u2019t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we\u2019ve tracked since July. Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED TV for $1,498 ($100 off) : The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier model with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set \u2014 near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag \u2014 with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs . It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn\u2019t support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and reviews we trust say that the LG C5 , a competing WOLED model, retains darker black levels in a bright room. (The S90F has a more colorful image, though.) We saw this 55-inch model go for $100 less earlier in the month, but this deal matches the best price we\u2019ve tracked otherwise. The 65-inch version is similarly discounted. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Shady, we know. Sony Bravia 8 II 65-inch QD-OLED TV for $2,998 ($502 off) : It\u2019s certainly not cheap, but the Sony Bravia 8 II has earned plaudits for its excellent image processing, upscaling and overall accuracy alongside the expected color, contrast and motion benefits of its QD-OLED display. This should help it make lots of movies and shows look closer to their original intent. It also uses the handy Google TV interface. Outside of an extremely brief dip in June, this deal matches the best price to date for the 65-inch version. That said, if you can\u2019t stomach the high price, other reviews note that the older Sony A95L offers similar performance a bit less, while more recent competitors like the LG G5 and Samsung S95F can get noticeably brighter (even if they\u2019re not always as accurate). Those two should be better for gaming as well, as the Bravia 8 II only has two HDMI 2.1 ports \u2014 one of which is an eARC port for soundbars \u2014 and its input lag is slightly higher. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) : The standard Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it comes with a slightly slower processor, half the storage (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people just looking for a casual streamer on the cheap, those shouldn\u2019t be huge losses. This model is also more powerful than the just-announced Fire TV 4K Select , though its Fire OS interface can still be messy and ad-heavy , with special emphasis on Amazon\u2019s own services. This deal is $3 more than the stick\u2019s all-time low, though it matches the best price we\u2019ve seen since Black Friday last year. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) : The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices . It can only stream up to 1080p, and it can run a bit choppier than the 4K models since it has a slower chipset and half the RAM (1GB). The usual issues with the Fire TV interface still apply here too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV or basic monitor for as little cash as possible, it should get the job done. This discount ties the device's lowest price to date.

A handful of well-reviewed sets from Samsung, Sony and other name brands are a bit cheaper than usual, including high-end OLEDs and more budget-friendly models alike. We\u2019ve picked through the best October Prime Day TV deals we can find below, and we\u2019ll update this roundup as prices change and more offers arise. Note that the Prime Big Deal Days sale, as the two-day event is technically called, officially runs October 7-8, with some deals exclusive to Prime subscribers. Best Prime Day TV deals Hisense U8QG 65-inch Mini-LED TV for $1,082 ($416 off) : Several reviews suggest that the Hisense U8QG ticks most of the requisite boxes for a LCD TV in 2025: robust local dimming and mini-LED backlighting, exceptionally high brightness, vibrant quantum-dot colors, a fast refresh rate (165Hz in this case), support for the major HDR formats and so on. It\u2019s a higher-end option than something like the TCL QM6K with much better brightness and contrast, though it still falls short of a good OLED TV when it comes to the latter. Like most LCD panels, it\u2019ll also look a bit washed out if you view it from an angle. It has three HDMI 2.1 ports, which is one fewer than many other TVs in this price range, though it uniquely includes a USB-C video input if you want to hook up a gaming laptop or Nintendo Switch. (Just note that you won\u2019t get VRR or HDR when using that.) You\u2019d mainly get it over an OLED TV if you\u2019re willing to trade some picture quality for something that\u2019s better-suited in a bright room. This deal on the 65-inch model isn\u2019t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we\u2019ve tracked since July. Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED TV for $1,498 ($100 off) : The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier model with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set \u2014 near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag \u2014 with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs . It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn\u2019t support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and reviews we trust say that the LG C5 , a competing WOLED model, retains darker black levels in a bright room. (The S90F has a more colorful image, though.) We saw this 55-inch model go for $100 less earlier in the month, but this deal matches the best price we\u2019ve tracked otherwise. The 65-inch version is similarly discounted. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Shady, we know. Sony Bravia 8 II 65-inch QD-OLED TV for $2,998 ($502 off) : It\u2019s certainly not cheap, but the Sony Bravia 8 II has earned plaudits for its excellent image processing, upscaling and overall accuracy alongside the expected color, contrast and motion benefits of its QD-OLED display.

Prime Big Deal Days, as it\u2019s officially called, doesn\u2019t technically begin until October 7, but we\u2019re keeping an eye out for the best Apple deals that are going on in the lead-up to the event. So far, we\u2019ve found a few decent prices on iPads and MacBooks, along with a few modest but early discounts on the recent crop of Apple Watches. You can find our full roundup below, and we\u2019ll be updating this post over the course of the week as more offers pop up. Best Prime Day Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $90 (30 percent off): Apple's entry-level wireless earbuds are the best AirPods for folks on a budget. They have an open-ear design that some will prefer over eartips that stick into your ears full, plus they have much improved audio quality and the H2 chip that enables features like Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and Adaptive EQ. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4, 512GB) for $999 ($200 off) : The MacBook Air tops our guide to the best laptops . The latest model isn\u2019t a major overhaul, but it\u2019s still exceptionally thin, lightweight and well-designed, and the M4 chip is more than powerful enough for everyday use. This deal is just a few bucks below the best price we\u2019ve seen for a configuration with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Other configs with more memory are $200 off as well. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4, 512GB) for $1,199 ($200 off) : The 15-inch MacBook Air is essentially the same as the 13-inch version, only it has a roomier display, a more spacious trackpad and better speakers. This is another discount we\u2019ve seen plenty of times before, but it\u2019s only slightly higher than the all-time low for a model with 512GB of storage. Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $75 ($24 off) : With its enormous finding network and ultra-wideband tech for accurately locating nearby items, Apple\u2019s AirTag is the top pick for iPhone users in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers . We saw a four-pack fall as low as $65 earlier in the year, but this is still a nice drop from Apple\u2019s list price. If you\u2019re not in desperate need for these, though, note that we may see an updated model later this year. Apple iPad (A16, 256GB) for $399 ($50 off) : The entry-level iPad earned a score of 84 in our review: If you mainly want a tablet for streaming, browsing the web, emailing or lighter word processing, it should do the job. It doesn\u2019t lose out on the Mac-style productivity features introduced with iPadOS 26 either. We\u2019ve seen this discount on the 256GB model fairly often in recent months, and it\u2019s about $25 above the device\u2019s all-time low, but it\u2019s still $50 cheaper than buying directly from Apple. Apple iPad Air (11-inch, 128GB) for $449 ($150 off): The best iPad for most people, the latest iPad Air runs on the powerful M3 chip, has an improved display and supports the Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard. This model has better performance and multitasking capabilities than its predecessor, and it's available in both 11- and 13-inch sizes. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off) : This latest iteration of Apple\u2019s tiny PC has a smaller footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end config with Apple\u2019s M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal is for the entry-level model with the base M4 chip and a 256GB SSD \u2014 it\u2019s $30 above the all-time low but still a nice savings. Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS + Cellular) for $329 ($170 off) : As a general rule, most people should buy the newest version of whatever Apple product they want. That said, the Series 11 is only a minor upgrade over the prior Series 10 \u2014 the glass is more scratch-resistant, the cellular model has 5G support, the battery is marginally bigger and that\u2019s about it. If you\u2019re mostly worried about saving cash, want LTE support and still need the more advanced health features the Apple Watch SE lacks, this is a worthwhile discount for a version of last year\u2019s model with cellular support. Apple Watch SE (2nd gen, 40mm, GPS + Cellular) for $189 ($110 off) : The Apple Watch SE 3 is a far more substantial upgrade over its predecessor than the Series 11, so we strongly recommend paying the premium to get the latest version. But if you\u2019re sure you can live without the always-on display, faster charging, superior chip and other upgrades that come with the SE 3, the last-gen model can still get you most of the basic Apple Watch experience for less cash while it remains in stock. This is one of the lowest prices we\u2019ve seen for the 40mm cellular model.

Subscribe to the ResiClub newsletter . When assessing home price momentum, ResiClub believes it\u2019s important to monitor active listings and months of supply. If active listings start to rapidly increase as homes remain on the market for longer periods, it may indicate pricing softness or weakness. Conversely, a rapid decline in active listings could suggest a market that is tightening or heating up. Since the national Pandemic Housing Boom fizzled out in 2022, the national power dynamic has slowly been shifting directionally from sellers to buyers. Of course, across the country that shift has varied significantly. Generally speaking, local housing markets where active inventory has jumped above pre-pandemic 2019 levels have experienced softer home price growth (or outright price declines) over the past 36 months. Conversely, local housing markets where active inventory remains far below pre-pandemic 2019 levels have, generally speaking, experienced more resilient home price growth over the past 36 months. Where is national active inventory headed? National active listings as tracked by Realtor.com are on the rise on a year-over-year basis (+17% between September 2024 and September 2025). This indicates that homebuyers have gained some leverage in many parts of the country over the past year. Some sellers markets have turned into balanced markets, and more balanced markets have turned into buyers markets. Nationally, we\u2019re still below pre-pandemic 2019 inventory levels (-10% below September 2019) and some resale markets, in particular chunks of the Midwest and Northeast, still remain tight-ish. While national active inventory is still up year-over-year, the pace of growth has slowed in recent months\u2014more than typical seasonality would suggest\u2014as some sellers have thrown in the towel and delisted (more on that in another piece).

Below is the year-over-year percentage change by state: While active housing inventory is rising in most markets on a year-over-year basis, some markets still remain tight-ish (although it\u2019s loosening in those places, too). As ResiClub has been documenting, both active resale and new homes for sale remain the most limited across huge swaths of the Midwest and Northeast. That\u2019s where home sellers this spring had, relatively speaking, more power. In contrast, active housing inventory for sale has neared or surpassed pre-pandemic 2019 levels in many parts of the Sunbelt and Mountain West, including metro area housing markets such as Punta Gorda and Austin. Many of these areas saw major price surges during the Pandemic Housing Boom, with home prices getting stretched compared to local incomes. As pandemic-driven domestic migration slowed and mortgage rates rose, markets like Tampa and Austin faced challenges, relying on local income levels to support frothy home prices. This softening trend was accelerated further by an abundance of new home supply in the Sunbelt. Builders are often willing to lower prices or offer affordability incentives (if they have the margins to do so) to maintain sales in a shifted market, which also has a cooling effect on the resale market: Some buyers, who would have previously considered existing homes, are now opting for new homes with more favorable deals. That puts additional upward pressure on resale inventory. At the end of September 2025, 15 states were above pre-pandemic 2019 active inventory levels: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Washington. (The District of Columbia\u2014which we left out of this analysis\u2014is also back above pre-pandemic 2019 active inventory levels. Softness in D.C. proper predates the current administration\u2019s job cuts.) Big picture: Over the past few years, we\u2019ve observed a softening across many housing markets as strained affordability tempers the fervor of a market that was unsustainably hot during the Pandemic Housing Boom. While home prices are falling some in pockets of the Sunbelt , a big chunk of Northeast and Midwest markets still eked out a little price appreciation this spring.

Softness in D.C. proper predates the current administration\u2019s job cuts.) Big picture: Over the past few years, we\u2019ve observed a softening across many housing markets as strained affordability tempers the fervor of a market that was unsustainably hot during the Pandemic Housing Boom. While home prices are falling some in pockets of the Sunbelt , a big chunk of Northeast and Midwest markets still eked out a little price appreciation this spring. Nationally aggregated home prices have been pretty close to flat in 2025. Click to expand. Below is another version of the table above\u2014but this one includes every month since January 2017.

Once the laughingstock of the gadget world with their dusty bags and tiny wheels, today's vacuums are sleek dirt-destroying machines, capable of rendering a house habitable no matter how many cats live in it. Some of them are even robots that will do the cleaning for you. For October Prime Day , Amazon has steeply cut the prices of some of the best vacuums (and some pretty good ones alongside). Now is a fantastic time to upgrade your cleaner, so check out the list below for our best recommendations. Best Prime Day vacuum deals Dyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 (33 percent off): Our top pick for the best cordless vacuum on the market right now, the V15 Detect has some of the strongest suction power you'll find in a stick vacuum, plus a lightweight design and a dustbin that can hold more dirt and debris than it might seem. This model comes with five cleaning attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has LEDs to illuminate the floor as you're vacuuming so you can better see where all the dust bunnies are. Dyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum for $410 (38 percent off): Dyson is still the king of reinventing vacuums, and the bagless, hyper-maneuverable Ball Animal is a blast to use. The Ball design is based on ease of steering, but the hidden MVP is the sealing \u2014 from the head to the canister, not a hair is getting out of this one once it's in. Shark AV2501AE AI Robot Vacuum for $459 (29 percent off): If you like the look of the AV2501S but have even more space to clean, the AV2501AE is also on sale. Its self-empty base can go a full 60 days before you have to dump it out, so it's ideal for large spaces, complex homes or areas that see heavy use. It's got the same features otherwise, including LiDAR mapping and two hours of autonomous work. Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch for $450 (55 percent off): This robotic mop/vacuum combo is engineering so you'll almost never need to revisit it after you set it up. It can clean its own mop, refill its own water tank and empty its own dustbin for up to 30 days at a time. It's also equipped with air jets that blast dirt out of corners the vacuum can't fit into. Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): The Shark Matrix Plus takes the robot vacuum concept even further by working a mop into the design for hands-off wet cleaning. This model is self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-charging and capable of tackling ground-in stains on hard floors. Shark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe for $160 (27 percent off): Moving into manual vacuums, let's start with one of the best. The Shark Navigator Lift-Away is a champion at getting deeply ingrained crud out of carpets, but it's also capable of squaring away bare floors. You can switch between the two settings quickly, and the lift-away canister makes it easy to empty. iRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off, Prime exclusive): This entry-level Roomba is a good pick for anyone who's new to owning a robot vacuum. It features a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush to clean all types of flooring, and it uses LiDAR navigation to avoid obstacles as it goes. The iRobot mobile app lets you control the robot, set cleaning schedules and more. iRobot Roomba Plus 504 for $380 (36 percent off): For those looking to upgrade to a more advanced robot vacuum, the Roomba Plus 504 is a great next step. It can clean almost anything that might land on a home floor, and if it can't clean it, it can steer around it. Two brushes and strong suction get at tougher stains, and it even includes an app you can use to set cleaning zones and change suction force remotely. Levoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $250 (29 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums , this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge. Amazon Basics Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner for $55 (21 percent off): All right, nobody goes to Amazon Basics to be impressed, but we have to admit this vacuum exceeds expectations. It's light, it has a big dust reservoir and it comes with all the attachments you'll need for a reasonably sized apartment. The filter is also simple to remove and clean. Black+Decker QuickClean Cordless Handheld Vacuum for $27 (33 percent off): Rounding out the list, we've got this small-but-mighty hand vacuum, perfect for crevices, shelves or cleaning out your car. It weighs about 1.4 pounds and hoovers up small messes in the blink of an eye. The lithium-ion battery stays charged for up to 10 hours.

Walmart is cleaning up its private-label ingredients Walmart announced plans this week to eliminate the use of synthetic dyes and 30 additives across its Great Value, Marketside, Freshness Guaranteed, and Bettergoods brands by January 2027.

For those who haven't heard of SSDs, they're physical upgrades that stack on top of a device's storage to make more files accessible at once. The more data a console or PC can hold at a time, the quicker it can retrieve and process that data, which makes everything run faster. Here are the best SSD deals we've managed to find on Amazon. Best October Prime Day SSD deals Crucial X10 4TB Portable SSD for $240 (39 percent off): The Crucial X9 is our current favorite portable SSD , but the X10 is a step beyond. Based on USB 3.2, it's compatible with a wide range of devices, and reaches reading speeds of 2,100MB/s \u2014 all in an extremely portable pocket-sized case. Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD for $64 (33 percent off): The BX500 is Crucial's budget-conscious SSD option, but that doesn't mean it disappoints.

Crucial P310 2TB for $122 (49 percent off): The 2TB level of the Crucial P310 is available at the lowest price we've seen all year. It's a compact drive that works great in small laptops or Steam Decks \u2014 especially the latter, given Valve's warning against cramming in large SSDs . For this small size and great price, you get read speeds of over 7,000MB/s. Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB for $70 (33 percent off): This is an incredible deal on an internal SSD from a reliable brand. All capacities of the Samsung 990 Evo Plus are currently on sale, but even the 1TB option can visibly boost your performance with top read speeds of 7,250MB/s. There's no heatsink, but nickel plating on the controller reduces both heat output and energy use. Samsung 990 PRO 2 TB for $170 (19 percent off): Samsung's 990 Pro series represents a massive leap forward for the brand, cutting energy costs by around half while boosting speeds up to at least 7,000MB/s write and 5,000MB/s read. This version comes with 2TB of storage and its own built-in heatsink. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): The Samsung Fit Plus isn't just the best thumb drive on the market right now \u2014 it's one of the best SSDs , period. This deal gets you 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s for almost unfathomably cheap. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Kingston SX1000 1TB High Performance for $105 (9 percent off): If you can't swing a Crucial X9 or X10 right now, Kingston offers a much more affordable alternative. The SX1000 can handle both PC backups and gaming storage with ease, nearly matching the X9 in our speed tests. It's also easy to carry around, though keep a tight grip as it's not officially rated for any drop height. SanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable SSD for $148 (29 percent off): The SanDisk Extreme line of portable SSDs provides a great middle ground in both price and performance. Read speeds of 1,050MB/s are enough for transferring most files you'll encounter day-to-day. Its external design holds up too, with a large carabiner loop, IP65 waterproofing and dustproofing and drop protection as high as three meters. Seagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB for $250 (31 percent off): This SeaGate SSD is specifically for expanding storage on the Xbox Series X and S, and it's designed to meet Xbox specs exactly. You'll get exactly the same performance booting a game from this card as you would from internal Xbox storage, which makes data management infinitely easier.

For those who haven't heard of SSDs, they're physical upgrades that stack on top of a device's storage to make more files accessible at once. The more data a console or PC can hold at a time, the quicker it can retrieve and process that data, which makes everything run faster. Here are the best SSD deals we've managed to find on Amazon. Best October Prime Day SSD deals Crucial X10 4TB Portable SSD for $240 (39 percent off): The Crucial X9 is our current favorite portable SSD , but the X10 is a step beyond. Based on USB 3.2, it's compatible with a wide range of devices, and reaches reading speeds of 2,100MB/s \u2014 all in an extremely portable pocket-sized case. Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD for $64 (33 percent off): The BX500 is Crucial's budget-conscious SSD option, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. This internal solid state drive cuts down on battery consumption and improves processing with read speeds reaching 540MB/s. It comes with a three-year warranty, too.

But we wouldn\u2019t blame you if you didn\u2019t know how to figure out if that laptop you\u2019re eyeing actually has a good discount for Prime Day, or if the deal is stale. That\u2019s where Engadget can help. We\u2019ve poured over the Prime Day laptop deals available this year to pick out the best ones you can get across all kinds of computers. If you\u2019re super picky about the specs you want in a new laptop, we always recommend going straight to the manufacturer so you can configure the machine exactly to your needs. But if you\u2019re willing to work with premade models, October Prime Day deals could help you save some cash on your next laptop. Best Prime Day laptop deals: MacBooks Apple\u2019s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, and we recommend getting those if you want a device that\u2019s as future-proof as possible at the moment. You\u2019ll find decent MacBook deals on Amazon throughout the year, and most of them will be on the base configurations. In a welcomed update earlier this year, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you\u2019ll find on the base-level Pros). Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $1,078 (10 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4) for $1,399 (13 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4) for $2,249 (10 percent off) Best Prime day laptop deals: Windows laptops You\u2019ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 16GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you\u2019re looking for a new gaming laptop, you\u2019ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. HP Ultrabook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100) for $280 (20 percent off) Lenovo IdeaPad 1i (Windows 11, 15-inch, Intel Celeron) for $280 (30 percent off) Acer Aspire 3 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i3) for $400 (11 percent off) Dell 15 3530 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $649 (28 percent off) Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i7) for $800 (27 percent off) Best Prime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks Most Chromebooks are already pretty cheap, but that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. However, there are a ton of premium Chromebooks available today that didn\u2019t exist even three years ago, so now is a great time to look out for discounts on those models. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver.

The best deals include the laptop-compatible Prime Power Bank (26,250mAh, 300W) , which is 20 percent off and down to $184 when you clip the on-page coupon on its Amazon page. This portable charger delivers a whopping 300W of total output between its two USB-C ports and single USB-A port. Anker says that, thanks to its 140W output (and if you're using a 5A cable), you can top up the battery of an M4 Pro MacBook Pro to 50 percent in 27 minutes and an iPhone 17 Pro Max to 50 percent in 22 minutes. You can keep tabs on what's happening on each port using the display. This is also the first Anker power bank that supports up to 250W of input recharging by using both USB-C ports simultaneously. This faster charging can top up the powerbank's own battery to 50 percent in just 13 minutes, according to Anker. This model has a capacity of 26,250mAh (99.75Wh), which is very close to the FAA's limit of 100W. It's TSA-approved, so you'll be able to take it on flights. It's capable of taking an M4 MacBook Pro from fully dead to an 80 percent charge. The power bank weighs 1.3 lbs \u2014 the same as about three iPhones, Anker says. Other Anker Prime devices are on sale too. A new 3-in-1 MagSafe charger \u2014 which can top up the batteries of your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods with wireless charging case simultaneously \u2014 also gets a 20 percent discount to $184 when you use a clippable coupon. While there are certainly less expensive 3-in-1 MagSafe options out there, this one includes Qi2 25W support for faster charging, as well as TEC active cooling. Anker suggests this can help speed up charging times and help guard against iPhone battery degradation over time. A three-port GaN Prime Charger that plugs into an outlet is 20 percent off too, at $120 with a clippable coupon . Anker says it's as compact as an AirPods Pro 3 case and can provide a total output of 160W, with up to 140W via a single USB-C cable. The charger is said to offer smart power distribution, and you can monitor what's happening and adjust modes via an onboard display and controls.

The best deals include the laptop-compatible Prime Power Bank (26,250mAh, 300W) , which is 20 percent off and down to $184 when you clip the on-page coupon on its Amazon page. This portable charger delivers a whopping 300W of total output between its two USB-C ports and single USB-A port. Anker says that, thanks to its 140W output (and if you're using a 5A cable), you can top up the battery of an M4 Pro MacBook Pro to 50 percent in 27 minutes and an iPhone 17 Pro Max to 50 percent in 22 minutes. You can keep tabs on what's happening on each port using the display. This is also the first Anker power bank that supports up to 250W of input recharging by using both USB-C ports simultaneously. This faster charging can top up the powerbank's own battery to 50 percent in just 13 minutes, according to Anker. This model has a capacity of 26,250mAh (99.75Wh), which is very close to the FAA's limit of 100W. It's TSA-approved, so you'll be able to take it on flights. It's capable of taking an M4 MacBook Pro from fully dead to an 80 percent charge. The power bank weighs 1.3 lbs \u2014 the same as about three iPhones, Anker says. Other Anker Prime devices are on sale too. A new 3-in-1 MagSafe charger \u2014 which can top up the batteries of your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods with wireless charging case simultaneously \u2014 also gets a 20 percent discount to $184 when you use a clippable coupon. While there are certainly less expensive 3-in-1 MagSafe options out there, this one includes Qi2 25W support for faster charging, as well as TEC active cooling. Anker suggests this can help speed up charging times and help guard against iPhone battery degradation over time. A three-port GaN Prime Charger that plugs into an outlet is 20 percent off too, at $120 with a clippable coupon . Anker says it's as compact as an AirPods Pro 3 case and can provide a total output of 160W, with up to 140W via a single USB-C cable.

Thanks to Prime Day deals that you can already get now, you can get one of our favorite Roku streaming devices for less than $30. The Roku Streaming Stick Plus is on sale for just $24 right now, which is 40 percent off and the lowest price we've seen. We picked the Streaming Stick Plus as the best streaming device for free and live content, thanks in large part to The Roku Channel app that accompanies it. The Roku Channel features over 500 free TV channels with live news, sports coverage and a rotating lineup of TV shows and movies. In our hands-on review of the Roku Streaming Stick Plus, we thought it was perfect for travel thanks to its small size and the fact that it can be powered by your TV's USB port, nixing the need for a wall adapter. Menu navigation and opening or closing apps won't happen at quite the same speeds as more expensive streamers, but it's quick enough for what is ultimately a pretty low-cost option. The Wi-Fi range on this one is also weaker than Roku's pricier devices, but unless you are placing it exceedingly far from your router, it shouldn't be an issue. The Roku Streaming Stick Plus supports both HD and 4K TVs, as well as HDR10+ content. It doesn't support Dolby Vision, however; for that you'll need to upgrade to Roku's Streaming Stick 4K or Roku Ultra. It comes with Roku's rechargeable voice remote with push-to-talk voice controls. Roku's remote can also turn on your TV and adjust the volume while you're watching. If you've been thinking about getting a Roku device, or you already love the platform and want a compact and convenient way to take it with you when you travel, then this sale provides a great opportunity. If you'd prefer a more powerful and slightly more stationary device, the Roku Ultra is on sale for $69 right now, too.

Amazon's October Prime Day has the AirPods 4 on sale for $90, or 30 percent off their usual price. That's also the lowest we've seen them. When Apple updated its standard AirPods in 2024, it released two models: one with active noise cancellation (ANC) and one without. We consider the non-ANC models to be the best budget AirPods you can get, so they're an even better buy at this sale price. The ANC versions are also discounted at the moment, so you can pick them up for $140 instead of the usual $180. The AirPods' H2 chip brings a bunch of Pro-adjacent features to the standard model. That list includes Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, Transparency, Personalized Spatial Audio and wireless charging. For calls, it supports Voice Isolation, which helps filter out background noise and make it easier for you to be heard. And if that call is via FaceTime, it supports Apple's 48kHz \"cinema-quality\" audio. Sound is improved over the AirPods 3. \"There's more low-end tone than the previous model right out of the gate, and the punchier treble opens the sound stage so it's wider and more immersive,\" Engadget's Billy Steele wrote . \"The improved frequency response is on full display with Dolby Atmos content (movies, music, and TV), but the AirPods 4 are also more sonically adept with non-spatial tunes and video.\" You can expect around five hours of battery life on a single charge. With the ANC model, that estimate drops to around four hours with the marquee feature activated. With either version, you can drop them in the charging case to extend their total time to around 30 hours. And hey, it's good to give your ears a rest now and then anyway.

That list includes Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, Transparency, Personalized Spatial Audio and wireless charging. For calls, it supports Voice Isolation, which helps filter out background noise and make it easier for you to be heard. And if that call is via FaceTime, it supports Apple's 48kHz \"cinema-quality\" audio. Sound is improved over the AirPods 3. \"There's more low-end tone than the previous model right out of the gate, and the punchier treble opens the sound stage so it's wider and more immersive,\" Engadget's Billy Steele wrote . \"The improved frequency response is on full display with Dolby Atmos content (movies, music, and TV), but the AirPods 4 are also more sonically adept with non-spatial tunes and video.\" You can expect around five hours of battery life on a single charge. With the ANC model, that estimate drops to around four hours with the marquee feature activated. With either version, you can drop them in the charging case to extend their total time to around 30 hours. And hey, it's good to give your ears a rest now and then anyway.

You'll need to be a Prime member to take advantage of the offer on the Shark AV2501S AI Ultra robot vacuum , but if you are, you can get the device for over half off. The discount drops the price from $550 to $230. That means you can snap up the robot vacuum for $320 below list price. The discount marks a record low for this model. Shark offers several variations of its AI Ultra robot vacuums. There are small variations between them, and a different model is our pick for the best robot vacuum for most people. In general, you can expect solid cleaning performance from these devices, along with accurate home mapping and an easy-to-use app. The model that's on sale here is said to run for up to 120 minutes on a single charge, which should be enough to clean an entire floor in a typical home. The self-emptying, bagless vacuum can store up to 30 days worth of dirt and debris in its base. Shark says it can capture 99.97 percent of dust and allergens with the help of HEPA filtration. If you'd rather plump for a model that's able to mop your floors too, you're in luck: a Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 vacuum is on sale as well. At $300 for Prime members, this vacuum is available for $400 (or 57 percent) off the list price. Its mopping function can scrub hard floors 100 times per minute.

It's also been equipped with specialized sensors to prevent falling down stairs. Steps are the natural enemy of all robot vacuums, except maybe this one . The Roomba 104 integrates with the company's proprietary app, which allows for custom cleaning schedules and the like. The robot can also be controlled via voice assistant and boasts compatibility with Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. The vacuum will automatically head to the charger for some juice when running low, which is nice. The battery lasts around 200 minutes per charge, which is a decent enough metric for a budget-friendly robovac. The only downside here? This is just a vacuum.
